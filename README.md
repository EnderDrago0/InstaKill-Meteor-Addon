## About

InstaKill is a shitty addon for the [Meteor Client](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client) created without knowledge of the code.\
The only thing this addon adds is InstaKill exploit module to the `Combat`.\
<br/>
Q: Will it be updated?\
A: Definitely not. This is my first experience with Meteor Client Addon API and I'm not going to continue working on it.

## How to use

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Sersoid/InstaKill-Meteor-Addon/releases) and put it in your mods folder with Meteor Client 4.7+

## Building
